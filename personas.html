      <p>In this project we were tasked with choosing an interface and observing users using the interface. I chose the CVS self checkout machines.
          We then were tasked with creating personas for the users and making a storyboard out of the their experience.

          <p>The CVS self checkout is a machine that consists of 4 main parts. There is the touch screen that
            has different screen based on where you are in the checkout process. 
            The first screen is motion activated, when a user walks up to the checkout, it appears. The second. Sketches of the different 
            screens are shown below. There is the scanner and scanning area that checks the items. Lastly there 
            is the credit card pad/reader where the user swipes/taps/ApplePays and enters a pin on a keypad if 
            necessary. There is also the bagging area which is important. The system keeps track of the weight
            in the bagging area and will get mad at the user if the weight does not increase after they scan an item.

        <li class="text-start" >Why did you choose self checkout over normal checkout? and would you choose it again?</li>

    <ul style="padding-left: 8rem; padding-right: 8rem; color: white;"> 
        <li class="text-start"> The majority of people had no issues using the system besides forgetting to click buttons or troubles scanning items
        <li class="text-start" > Everyone using self checkout had very few items</li>
        <li class="text-start" >The bagging area is on the left on some machines despite the images on the screen instructing
            people to move their items to the right.</li>
        <li  class="text-start" >Not moving an item to the bagging area will cause an error </li>

        <li class="text-start">There were 3 main difficulties experienced: People not reading the instructions, the scanner not working, and the bagging area being unclear</li>
        
        <li class="text-start">Despite the difficulties all users said the system was easy to use</li>
    </ul>
    <h5 class="text-start"  style="padding-left: 8rem;color: white;">Summary</h5>
    <ul style="padding-left: 8rem; padding-right: 8rem;color: white;"> 
        <li class="text-start">Most users either didn't have any reaction of a feeling from the interface.
            The ones that did felt confused, frustrated, or annoyed. The cause of these reaction were from 
            something in the interface not functioning as it should
        </li>
        <li class="text-startcolor: white;" >Some users chose self checkout because they believed it was faster, and they were in a rush,
            while others chose it because they don't like talking to people. A few of the interviewees chose it
             because the line was just shorter and it made more sense. Everyone said they would use it again despite any difficulties.
