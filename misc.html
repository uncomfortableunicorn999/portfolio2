            <h2>What are Personas and Storyboards?</h2>
            <p>Personas and Storyboards are two of the most important tools in the UI/UX design process. They help us understand the user's needs and goals with an interface. These tools are relatively simple, but provide high impact! Let's dive into these two tools, and see them come to life with regard to the self-checkout macines at the Thayer Street CVS!</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Personas -->
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h4>Personas</h4>
            <p>Personas are fictional, archetypal characters that represent a group of users. They are created based on research and data, and are used to extract the goals and needs of the users. They are also used to understand users' emotions and motivations!</p>
            <p>The method used to create the personas below are via an <b>empathy map</b>. An empathy map focuses on one persona and there characteristics are split into four quadrants: "Thinks", "Feels", "Says", "Does". This provides a comprehensive idea of what the persona is!</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Storyboarding -->
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h4>Storyboards</h4>
            <p>Storyboards are a series of images that tell a narrative about a user interacting with an interface. Similar to Personas, they are also used to understand a user's goals and needs. Storyboards do this by honing in on one persona and providing a story, from beginning to end, of that persona's interactions with the interface.</p>
            <p>Further, Storyboards are concise and convey a real scenario and the emotions the persona may feel at each step of the story.</p>

            <h2>The CVS Self-Checkout Interface</h2>
            <p>Let's take a look at the CVS Self-Checkout Interface, and see how we can use Personas and Storyboarding to understand the user's needs and goals!</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Overview -->
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>The <b>CVS Self-Checkout</b> provides an interface to scan and pay for items at a user's own pace. The user takes control of the checkout process, and eliminates the need for a cashier to be present when checking out!</p>
            <p>The interface provides instructions on the main kiosk screen to guide users at each step of the checkout process. Next, there is a scanner for items and coupons, and then two bagging areas: one for CVS paper bags and a separate area for users who prefer to use their own bags. Then, there is a separate payment kiosk to pay using a card or contactless NFC technology (and some contain an area for cash below the scanner). Lastly, the interface contains an indicator light to flag employees when requesting assistance and separate light to indicate if a machine is open!</p>
            <p>Let's break down each component! <b>Tap each heading on the right to see its description</b>:</p>

            <h2>User Observations and Interviews</h2>
            <p>In order to construct Personas and a Storyboard for the CVS interface, <b>3 interviews</b> were conducted and recorded for reference. The first portion was to record observations and common patterns between users of the interface. Next, interview questions were asked to gauge each user experience.</p>
            <p>Below are the key observations taken from these users, as well as the interview questions and summary of responses to the questions.</p>

              <ul class="card-text">
                <li>When the user first interacted with the interface, they needed to pause to process <i>how</i> to start. Namely, putting their items down on the scanner will immediately trigger the “Scanning Phase," catching the user off guard. Sometimes the previous shopper will ignore the receipt screen, which the next user must first deal with before starting.</li>
                <li>Users finished scanning all items before considering the payment kiosk and all of the elements on the Main Display Kiosk. As such, most missed the graphic explaining where the “bagging area” is. As such, most users hesitated when figuring out where to put there scanned items.</li>
                <li>The users selected the “Use My Own Bags” button, which disables the interface for about 10 seconds, and elicits awkward pausing and taps on the interface to exit this mode (which does not work: the user must sit and wait for the screen to enable buttons again).</li>
                <li>Some users paid on the payment kiosk before selecting a payment method or reading the instructions on the Main Display Kiosk.</li>
                <li>All users smiled and appreciated the auditory instructions and feedback (e.g. beep after a scan or when a chime places when payment is processing) to know that a scan went through or their payment went through.</li>

              <ul class="card-text">
                <li>Users intuitively start scanning items without considering any other part of the interface. However, they may have to deal with past users not continuing past the receipt screen, which causes <b>confusion and frustration</b> from the beginning.</li>
                <li>Users have the goal of scanning at their own pace and paying quickly (most prefer contactless NFC payment). They prefer the self-checkout interface because of the sense of control it gives and straightforwardness of scanning and paying (it feels streamlined).They believe it gets the job done, and has fair instructions.</li>
                <li>Most confusion came from the bagging station interface, with the paper bags on the left and the area on the right. Further, a camera is used to detect if an item has not been scanned, which causes pressure and confusion when the user does not put their items in the bagging area.</li>
                <li>Users prefer to have a simpler interface with more explicit instructions beyond just auditory instructions and text on the side. They suggest full-screen pop-ups and the disabling of some features (e.g. swiping card) until the payment phase has been entered.</li>
                <li>All agreed that the interface on the main kiosk is crowded, and most buttons get tuned out. All users missed the bagging area instructions, were irritated by the payment selection screen, and reported that voice instructions were easy to miss. They felt that there was no clear focus on what the next step was in some cases.</li>
